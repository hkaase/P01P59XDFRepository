# P01P59XDFRepository
This repository aims to be the definitive source of XDFs for the GM Generation III/IV platform, for use with TunerPro to edit and modify OS calibrations.

Almost all XDFs here are unlocked, and are the most recent versions I could find across the internet. In the case of there being multiple XDFs, the best XDF to use will have *PREFERRED* in the title, and may either have an "Obsolete" subfolder if there are older versions of the same XDF, or may have other XDFs in the same folder. You should generally use the PREFERRED XDFs, but you may find that some functionality may not be present in the newer XDFs. 

Additionally, it should be noted that most of these XDFs have not been tested by me, so a certain degree of caution should be exercised using them. When in doubt, try some other XDFs first.
